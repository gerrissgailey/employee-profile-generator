## Description
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-None-blue.svg "License Badge")

This app is an employee/team profile generator. It utilizes the Inquirer Package from npmjs.com to grab a user's input and help create employee information cards on a team profile page. It also utilizes Jest to aid with TDD in order to test/verify that the class files will return the expected data.
